Before starting assembly, make sure you have the [electronics working and wires attached](../firmware/WIRING.md).

## Option A: 3D print
1. 3D print one of each STL file found in this folder
2. Insert [M3 heat inserts](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/threaded-inserts/0278534) into each hole on the body and the back piece
3. Insert the encoders into the front piece, secure each with nuts, attach the knobs and then attach to the body ![](Front.gif)
